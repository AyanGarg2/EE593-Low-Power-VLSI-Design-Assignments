This repository contains lab assignments for  EE593:Low Power VLSI Design(IIT Mandi). 

## Assignment 1: Design and analysis of a CMOS inverter, including:
1. Switching threshold estimation through DC VTC analysis. 
2. Propagation delay characterization (tPLH, tPHL) using transient simulations. 
3. Impact of transistor sizing on delay symmetry. 
4. Effect of input rise time on propagation delay and power consumption. 
5. Effect of load capacitance on delay and power. 
6. Operation under near-threshold supply voltage (VDD = Vtn + |Vtp|) for ultra-low-power analysis.
